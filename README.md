Halo Infinite game mode ideas

- canyon that launches across. Sniper or rockets maybe?
Try to kill in mid air. Or shotgun repulser 
- players fly over fisher man that try to grab them with grappling hook
- Bomberman
- paperboy, warthog and plasmas 
- TF2 payload on the launch site dev map (use forklift for this?)
- use forklift to place grunts in a box
